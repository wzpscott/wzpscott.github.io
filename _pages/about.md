About me
--
I am a junior undergraduate student at Beihang University. I will graduate as a Bachelor of Engineering in June 2022.  
I'm interested in artificial intellegence and related subjects. Currently, I'm working on knowledge distillation of vision transformers led by [Dr.Liu YiFan](https://irfanicmll.github.io/) .I've also done some research on citation network supervised by Prof. Zhang Junhuan and knowledge graph fusion supervised by Dr. Hu Jun.
